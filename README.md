## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

### Career

As a member of Dysonâ€™s New Product Innovation Software Team, I prototype a diverse range of cutting-edge products, using Rust, C++, Python, and Go with microservice architectures in Docker and RTOS-based systems. I explore and apply the latest technologies to bring Dysonâ€™s concepts to life, continuously investigating and integrating emerging innovations into product development.

Before Dyson, I worked at Witekio as a contractor specializing in Embedded Linux Board Support Packages, collaborating with clients to design Yocto builds, adapt Linux kernels, and integrate drivers.

Prior to Witekio, at Digital Concepts Engineering (secondment from Babcock), I helped prototype a Universal Controller using an STM32 microcontroller, creating a touchscreen interface for vehicle selection and custom communication protocols for autonomous vehicles, controlling a variety of vehicles, including a Ford Ranger, HX60, DCEs X Series Robots.

At Babcockâ€™s Technology Design Innovation team, I focused on battlefield fleet management, coordinating and controlling UGVs and UAVs, liaising with SMEs to integrate advanced tech. I also worked with KiCad, Eagle and Fusion to develop uUGVs capable of interacting with our fleet management system.

Earlier, I was part of the University of Strathclyde Eco Vehicle student society, where I developed a robust CAN Bus Communication Network for ECU modules. I collaborated with sub-teams to ensure a reliable network that met the projectâ€™s requirements.

In addition to this, I completed two internships in Robotic Systems. One was with the Carnegie Trust, where I analyzed network traffic and security breaches, and the other focused on developing an autonomous robot.

### Open Source Work

I also try to contibute to the following projects where I can:

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...

![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Rust-black?style=flat-square&logo=rust)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-black?style=flat-square&logo=typescript)
![Blender](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Blender-black?style=flat-square&logo=blender)

Iâ€™m currently diving into Rust, focusing on both embedded applications with no-std and user-facing applications using standard Rust. Alongside Rust, Iâ€™m exploring TypeScript and leveraging the Tauri framework to build modern, cross-platform graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Additionally, Iâ€™m developing my skills in Blender to create more artistic and organic CAD models, expanding my ability to design with a focus on fluid, natural forms.

## Tools and Languages

My General Toolkit is shown below, I love to explore different languages, tools and frameworks, throughout my career ive focused on trying out new things.

## Printables and Thingiverse

In addition to my work as an embedded software engineer, Iâ€™m passionate about creating physical objects with my 3D printer and integrating them with my software. Many of my designs can be found on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) and [Printables](https://www.printables.com/me/analytics/models).

## Printed Circuit Boards

In addition to CAD design, I have a passion for creating my own Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). You can explore many of these designs on my GitHub, and Iâ€™m excited to continue developing and sharing even more innovative boards in the future!
