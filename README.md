### Career

As a member of Dysonâ€™s New Product Innovation Software Team, I am rapidly prototyping a diverse range of cutting-edge products. Utilizing languages such as Rust, C++, Python, and Go, using both microservice architectures in Docker and RTOS based systems, I work at the forefront of technology, exploring and applying the latest innovations to bring Dysonâ€™s visionary concepts to life. My role involves continuous investigation of emerging technologies and seamlessly integrating them into the development of future products.

### Open Source Work

I also try to contibute to the following projects where I can:

[![Embedded Engineering Roadmap](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=m3y54m&repo=Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap&theme=gruvbox)](https://github.com/m3y54m/Embedded)
[![Embassy-rs Trouble](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=embassy-rs&repo=trouble&theme=gruvbox)](https://github.com/embassy-rs/trouble)

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...

![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Rust-black?style=flat-square&logo=rust)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-black?style=flat-square&logo=typescript)
![Blender](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Blender-black?style=flat-square&logo=blender)

Iâ€™m currently diving into Rust, focusing on both embedded applications with no-std and user-facing applications using standard Rust. Alongside Rust, Iâ€™m exploring TypeScript and leveraging the Tauri framework to build modern, cross-platform graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Additionally, Iâ€™m developing my skills in Blender to create more artistic and organic CAD models, expanding my ability to design with a focus on fluid, natural forms.

## Tools and Languages

My General Toolkit is shown below, I love to explore different languages, tools and frameworks, throughout my career ive focused on trying out new things.

## Printables and Thingiverse

In addition to my work as an embedded software engineer, Iâ€™m passionate about creating physical objects with my 3D printer and integrating them with my software. Many of my designs can be found on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) and [Printables](https://www.printables.com/me/analytics/models).

Here are a few highlights:

### 3D Printed Water Fountain
